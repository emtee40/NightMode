# NightMode
Android App to apply various filters on the screen and reduce brightness beyond minimum level

## Features
* Dim the screen beyong the minimum brightness level
* Apply different filters by easily changing the red, green, blue and alpha values

## Usage
  Using this app is extremely easy. Here a few tips to keep in mind.
  * If you only want to change the brightness, adjust the alpha value and keep the red, green, and blue filters at 0. This will darken the screen without any sort of filtering effect.
  * Adjust the red, green and blue values to apply different filters. Remember to change the alpha value too since you won't notice the effects if alpha is 0.
